sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field

standing strong
on this their chosen battle field

The glory and freedom of Ukraine has not yet perished
Luck will still smile on us brother-Ukrainians.
Our enemies will die, as the dew does in the sunshine,
and we, too, brothers, we'll live happily in our land.
